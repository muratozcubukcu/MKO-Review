  <h1>Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar: A Seafood Lover's Dream in Bellevue</h1>
  <p>Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar is a must-visit seafood destination for those in the Bellevue area. I recently visited the restaurant and tried their highly recommended Dungeness Crab Cakes served with Thai sweet-n-sour beurre blanc greens, and lemongrass vinaigrette. The crab cakes were packed with flavor and were incredibly fresh. The Thai sweet-n-sour beurre blanc greens added the perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess to the dish.</p>
  <p>The Fresh King Salmon dish at Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar was a true standout for me. The salmon was perfectly grilled and had a nice smoky flavor, which was balanced out with a tangy lemon vinaigrette. The Yukon Gold mashed potatoes were velvety and rich, with just the right amount of seasoning. The grilled asparagus was crisp, yet tender, and had a delicious charred taste. The combination of these elements made for an absolutely mouthwatering dish. The presentation was also impressive, with the salmon served atop the creamy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus arranged beautifully around it. I highly recommend trying this dish at Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar.</p>
  <p>The Cedar Plank Salmon dish at Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar was another standout for me. The salmon was cooked to perfection, with a smoky flavor that added depth and richness to the dish. The citrus rice was fluffy and had a slight tang that complemented the flavor of the salmon perfectly. The smoked broccoli was an unexpected but delicious accompaniment that added a unique touch to the dish. The presentation was impressive as well, with the salmon fillet served on a cedar plank, giving it a rustic and natural feel. The flavors and textures of this dish blended together perfectly, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and delicious seafood dish. Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar definitely knows how to make a great cedar plank salmon dish.</p>
  <p>Certainly, happy to expand on the fourth paragraph. The Steak & Lobster dish at Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar was an absolute delight. The Fire-grilled 8oz Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection, with a beautiful medium-rare interior and a charred exterior that added a smoky flavor. The brown butter-braised Maine lobster was incredibly rich and had a decadent flavor that paired well with the steak. The asparagus was tender and had a delicious crunch, while the creamy-cheesy russet potato hash was the perfect comfort food. The presentation was top-notch, with the steak and lobster placed on a bed of asparagus and the potato hash served in a separate dish. This dish was the epitome of surf and turf, with a great balance of flavors and textures. It is the perfect choice for those looking for a luxurious and delicious meal. I would highly recommend this dish to anyone visiting Seastar Restaurant & Raw Bar.</p>
