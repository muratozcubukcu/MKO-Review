  <p>Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the beautiful waterfront setting. Located on the edge of a marina, the restaurant offered stunning views of the water and boats passing by. The outdoor seating area was spacious and well-maintained, with comfortable tables and chairs arranged to take advantage of the scenery. The decor inside the restaurant was also inviting, with a nautical theme and cozy atmosphere. Wooden beams, fishing nets, and maritime-themed artwork adorned the walls, creating a welcoming and casual atmosphere. Overall, the setting at Anthony's HomePort was idyllic and set the stage for a wonderful dining experience.</p>
  <p>For my starter, I chose the seafood sampler appetizer, which included a selection of oysters, crab legs, and prawns. The seafood was extremely fresh and had a great taste, and the presentation was beautiful. The oysters were particularly noteworthy, with a briny flavor and a smooth, creamy texture. The crab legs were also a standout, with sweet, tender meat that was easy to extract from the shell. The prawns were plump and flavorful, and the accompanying cocktail sauce added a nice touch of tanginess. Overall, the seafood sampler was an excellent choice and got my meal off to a great start.</p>
  <p>For my main course, I ordered the Dungeness Crab linguine, which was cooked to perfection. The pasta was al dente and had a great texture, and the sauce was creamy and flavorful. The Dungeness Crab was the star of the dish, with sweet, succulent meat that was perfectly complemented by the sauce. The dish also included a generous amount of fresh vegetables, including bell peppers and onions, which added a nice crunch and flavor. The portion size of the Dungeness Crab linguine was generous, and I was pleasantly full by the end of my meal. Overall, the Dungeness Crab linguine was a delicious and satisfying main course that lived up to my expectations.</p>
